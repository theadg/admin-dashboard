# Admin Dashboard Using CSS Grid

This is my solution to The Odin Project's Project: Admin Dashboard. The [Odin Project] (https://www.theodinproject.com/about) provides a free open source coding curriculum that can be taken entirely online. Since its inception, it has helped many students get hired as developers and has assisted countless others in learning enough programming to work on their own personal projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

Build a dashboard design using mainly CSS Grid.

- Create HTML Markup for sidebar, header and main-content elements
- Apply CSS Grid properties for the basic layout

## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Grid

### What I learned

CSS Grid is such a powerful layout tool. It's the only layout tool I used for this project for me to truly grasp the powers of Grid. I must say, it gives me more control with the position of the elements on the layout.

### Continued development

I have yet to learn more about using Semantic HTML tags for better accessibility. Additionally, I will adjust the color of my elements to have better contrast. Also, I will have to improve my workflow to be more efficient with my time.
